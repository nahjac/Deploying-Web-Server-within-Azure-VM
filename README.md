# Deploying-Web-Server-within-Azure-VM
This tutorial outlines the implementation of an Ubuntu web server within an Azure virtual machine.
## Environments and Technologies Used
+ Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines)
+ Remote Desktop
+ Bash
## Operating Systems Used
+ Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS
## Deployment and Configuration Steps
In this lab, we're going to create a VM within a VNET in order to deploy our web server. This will require a Microsoft Azure account. First, you'll need to create a resource group. From your account homepage, select resource groups then create. A standard process of naming our resources so that we maintain organization is by using the format: type-region-application. An example could be RG-USE-Nextcloud. Click review+create then create. Your resource group is now created.
